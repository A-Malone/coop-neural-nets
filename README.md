# Genetic Neural Nets
This repository serves as a repository of my testing of using genetic algorithms to train neural networks.

OpenAi test
----
openai_test.py demonstrates the successful implementation of ESP-style decompostion to convert neural nets into genes which can be spliced together by neural nets. In this demonstration, the [Cart Pole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0) environment from OpenAI gym  is used as a test. The algorithm solves the problem (As defined by OpenAI gym) in as few as 8 100-individual generations.

Colearning (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
----
An attempt to train neural networks adversarily to play a simple combat game. Progress is on-going.
